  <h2>Website Goals:</h2>
  <p> Our website is designed to make managing your finances simple and something you can stick to. You can log what you spend and what you earn every day, and at the end of the week, you can see exactly where your money went. It shows you how much of your paycheck or allowance is already spent and how much you have left. So you can say "Bye-Bye" to going over budget. We wanted to build something that works for anyone who just needs a clear way to see their money without having to deal with complicated charts or confusing apps.</p>
  <p>The goal is not just to track numbers, but to help people develop better spending habits. The site makes it easy to check your progress and see the patterns in how you use your money. If someone is saving for something big, we set them on a clear path for achieving their goal. We kept it straightforward so you can use it every day without it feeling like a chore.

    <h2>Our Background:</h2>
  <p>We are a team consisting of one rising sophomore and one rising senior in high school, working together through the incredible All Star Code program. All Star Code has given us the opportunity to expand our programming skills, collaborate with like-minded peers, and create projects that solve real-world problems. As students, we've both experienced the struggle of keeping track of money, whether it's income from a part-time job, allowance, or school work and we wanted to design something that makes budgeting less intimidating.</p>
  <p>By combining our skills and creativity, we set out to create a budgeting platform that is straightforward, functional, and designed with our peers in mind. This project reflects our shared passion for technology and our desire to build tools that can have a real impact on people's lives. Thanks to All Star Code's guidance and resources, we were able to turn an idea into a working product that we're proud to share. It's not just about codingâ€”it's about problem-solving, teamwork, and creating something that can genuinely help others.</p>

  <h2>Who do we address?</h2>
</div>

  <div class="fourth-page-right">
  <p> This website is for anyone who wants to keep track of their money effortlessly. It can help students who are getting their first paychecks, people balancing school and part-time work, or just anyone trying to be more careful with how they spend. We want it to be useful for people who might not know much about budgeting but still want to be more organized with their money.</p>
  <p>It works for everyday spending like coffee or snacks, and also for bigger things like rent, bills, or saving up for something important. We made it so it can fit into your daily routine without taking up a lot of time. We hope that this tool helps people feel more in control of their money, no matter how much they make or spend each week.</p>
